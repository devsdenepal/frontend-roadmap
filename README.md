The frontend encompasses all elements visible to the user during their website visit, providing instant interaction and experience. In contrast, the backend operates behind the scenes, managing the storage, transmission, and reception of information.
> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files collectively form the foundation of all website elements. As a web developer, these are essential tools in your toolkit, serving as the fundamental languages required for constructing websites.
